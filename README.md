This is a repository for my word vector projects on the Anderson Intelligencer
The newspapers I am using span the period from 1860 to 1914. This is key to showing progress
since the Civil War ended in 1865 and through Reconstruction in 1877. The reason this is
important is that the industry in the South Carolina Upstate and Western North Carolina
Carolina did not reach its height till 1880, a few years after Reconstruction.
Although some mills were built before the Civil War, they were generally small endeavors. 

I wanted to look at textile culture in Anderson, South Carolina, specifically. I have looked
at the involvement of Clemson's Textile Education as a reason for the growth of the
textile industry. But in this study, I wanted to look specifically at the culture and social
aspects of the mills. The newspaper talks about things that happened in Anderson, SC, and
it is key to see that textiles and mills are often discussed in the papers.
