This is a repository for my word vector projects on the Anderson Intelligencer
The newspapers I am using span the period from 1860 to 1914. This is key to showing progress
since the Civil War ended in 1865 and through Reconstruction in 1877. The reason this is
important is that the industry in the South Carolina Upstate and Western North Carolina
Carolina did not reach its height till 1880, a few years after Reconstruction.
Although some mills were built before the Civil War, they were generally small endeavors.

I wanted to look at textile culture in Anderson, South Carolina, specifically. I have looked
at the involvement of Clemson's Textile Education as a reason for the growth of the
textile industry. But in this study, I wanted to look specifically at the culture and social
aspects of the mills. The newspaper talks about things that happened in Anderson, SC, and
it is key to see that textiles and mills are often discussed in the papers.

I have created four visualizations based on mills and textiles, as well as the involvement of men
and women. This is important because women and children were hired to work in the mills more than
men, especially in the early 1880s, when children and women were cheaper to hire. I did not find
anything to show the ages of workers. But in 1904, in South Carolina, a law was passed against children
younger than 10 years of age working. Child labor was a controversial topic in the early twentieth century.

Gender Comparison Plots Chart
Many of the terms in the article are connected to the feminine rather than
the masculine. But I found it interesting that some of the words most associated with women were treatment
and suffering, as well as disappointment. There were also fashionable, as well as impurities, connected
to women in the articles. Very few words were connected to man or men. Malaria also showed up as
one of the words most used. This addresses the problem that Anderson, South Carolina, had with the
disease. Malaria was a problem, especially between 1870 and 1914, which explains why malaria is
in some of the articles, and also brings up the seriousness of it. It made a more significant impact
on mortality than yellow fever or smallpox. Ailment is another aspect of the disease at the time.
This chart brings up a lot of questions relating to the hardships of this period in South Carolina,
but there is a tone of endurance, and even joyfulness. But this visualization brought up. A lot
of questions and some insight.

PCA Projection Chart
This visualization highlights topics clustered around discussions of textiles and mills. In the chart,
The words plotted the furthest away are words like excellence, exhibition, and Thoroughfare. Although
during this time, especially after the end of Reconstruction in 1877, there was a lot of growth in the towns
and cities of the South. Anderson was best known for bringing electricity to the textile industry in
The 1890s, which earned it the nickname "Electric City." This also points to Anderson's growth. Of course,
in this visualization, some words pertain specifically to textiles such as fabric, yarns, garment,
woven, fiber, and flax. This ties in to Anderson's strong connections to the textile industry. Other
themes involve prize, winners, and award. The connection for these within the articles refers to
Anderson's achievement of being the first city in the world to supply a cotton gin by electricity.
Anderson was the first city in the South to have an unlimited supply of electric power, starting with a
small hydroelectric plant on the Rocky River.

Dot Plotting Chart
This visualization also points to the electric city. The words closest to textiles also involve
prize, medals, and shows explicitly the word electricity close to textiles. This chart didn't bring
any new insights, but reinforced the words in PCA Projection Chart. The top words were also connected to
textiles, fabrics, yarn, and woven.

Dendrogram of Cultural Terms
This visualization wasn't as clearly connected as my other visualizations; its words include education
and electives. This could be connected to the opening of Clemson Agricultural College in 1893. There are
also words such as intellectually and technically. The word resort is also connected and made me ask
The question of whether Anderson, SC, had a resort? From 1870 to 1914, there was a hotel resort nearby
In Glenn Springs. The hotel offered private summer cottages, a bowling alley, a billiard saloon, croquet
grounds, and a fancy ballroom.
